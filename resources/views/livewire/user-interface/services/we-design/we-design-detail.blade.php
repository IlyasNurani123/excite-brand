                            Almost 60% of all internet searches are now conducted via mobile phones – a figure that will
                            only increase in the next few years. If your website is not yet mobile-ready, you’re
                            probably already losing out on a huge number of new customers every month.

                            Your website looks and functions differently depending on what kind of device it’s being
                            accessed from. This means that, although your site may look fantastic on a laptop, the
                            design may fall flat when viewed on a mobile phone. With nearly 60% of internet searches now
                            conducted via mobile, it’s essential that your website is on the same page. Statistics show
                            that many users will leave a web page within 10 to 20 seconds if it doesn’t grab their
                            attention or, they don’t find it user friendly. That means that you have less than half a
                            minute to keep hold of those potential customers. When it comes to your website, it’s all
                            about the customers; those you have and those that you want. At ExciteBrand, we have the
                            skill and experience to make sure that your website looks great, has optimal functionality,
                            and offers a seamless mobile experience, helping you to grab those customers – and keep

                            You know who you are but, do your customers? Most successful brands have one thing in common
                            – they are instantly recognisable. From McDonald’s’ golden arches to Carlsberg’s clever
                            slogans, a business wins or loses by its branding. The internet means that businesses are
                            able to be more visible than ever before. As great as that is, it has a downside – more
                            competition. Strong business branding is essential for companies looking to get ahead of the
                            competition. Cohesive, recognisable and respected, great branding helps your customers to
                            find and connect with your business quickly and easily – meaning increased customer
                            retention, return business and recommendations.
