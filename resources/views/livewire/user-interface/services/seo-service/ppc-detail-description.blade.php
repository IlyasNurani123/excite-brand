                        <p class="dpm-description">
                            PPC, otherwise known as cost-per-click (CPC), is an online advertising model used by
                            companies to increase website traffic. A publisher, which is usually a search engine such as
                            Google, or a website, will show advertisements for the company and each time a visitor
                            clicks on these adverts and is directed to the company website, the company will pay a fee.
                            With search engines, an advertiser (i.e. the company) will usually bid on keywords that are
                            relevant to the market they are targeting, social media sites have also started using
                            pay-per-click advertising models. Whereas other websites will charge a fixed price for each
                            click instead of using a bidding system. CCP advertising is considered especially useful as
                            it conveys more information regarding how effective the marketing campaign has been. To
                            understand pay-per-click in more detail, read through the information available on
                            Wikipedia.

                            According to Forbes, PPC visitors are 50% more likely to become a paying customer than those
                            who visit your website through an organic search result. With this in mind, it is a good
                            idea to spend some time trying to understand PPC and the benefits it can have for your
                            business.

                            If you are interested in completing your own PPC services, you will need to take the time to
                            understand how Google Ads work. Fortunately, Google provides a range of Google Ad
                            certifications that can help you to do this. Become certified in search, display, video,

                        <p class="dpm-description">
                            According to Forbes there are four main benefits of PPC marketing:

                            Results are instantaneous: with content marketing it takes time to write and publish content
                            and for this to turn into website leads, therefore traffic increases over time. With PPC
                            advertising traffic increases instantly and can be turned on and off at any time.
                            When PPC has been set-up by professional PPC management services the tracking will evidence
                            these immediate results.

                            You only pay when someone clicks on your link: with other methods of online advertising,
                            such as cost per impression (CPM), you pay simply for your advert to be shown. Whereas with
                            CPP you only get charged if a customer sees your advert and clicks on the link to be
                            redirected to your website. As a result, you waste less money showing your advert to an
                            audience that is not interested in your goods/services.
                            Targeting your audience: with PPC you have more control over where, when and to who your
                            advert is shown. Through your PPC strategy you can select your audience, the ideal time to
                            reach them and the best place for your advert to be shown. By researching your target
                            audience you can learn their online behaviour and find out when the best time to advertise
                            is (i.e. when they’re online), you can also choose locations for your adverts or set a local
                            audience. This helps you to target an audience that is more likely to convert into paying
                            customers.
                            PPC helps your SEO: for your website to be successful you need to rank highly in search
                            engine results, which you are not going to be able to do if your SEO is not strong enough.
                            PPC helps you to analyse your keyword impression data (i.e. how many people see your ad) so
                            that you can see which keywords are most popular. It will also give you an idea of what
                            long-tail keywords are that you can use to help optimise the content on your website.
                            In order for your PPC campaign to be successful, it is essential that you properly research
                            your target audience and keywords etc, this is often where using PPC management services
                            comes in most beneficial. PPC marketing services not only conduct the research to create the
                            ideal strategy for your business, but they also implement these strategies to ensure you
                            benefit from all of the above and much more.

                        <p class="dpm-description">
                            A Google Adwords agency is similar to that of a PPC company. They work with clients to
                            create (or take-over) Google Adwords campaigns, while ensuring a strong ROI. As they are
                            experienced in using Adwords there are numerous benefits to using a Google Adwords company,
                            these include:

                            Familiarity: If you are new to Google Adwords you might find that getting the right strategy
                            in place is a trial and error process. It can take days, weeks, or even months to find a
                            marketing strategy that works effectively for your business and with your target audience.
                            When you use a Google Adwords agency they are familiar with the process and the industry,
                            which removes the trial and error and provides you with a strategy that is effective
                            immediately.
                            Beta Testing: Google Adwords agencies are a source of income for Google, for this reason,
                            they often get opportunities that other businesses handling their own PPC strategy do not,
                            such as beta testing. This gives clients a chance to try new methods that their competition
                            may not have access to.
                            New perspectives: If you run your own Google Adwords campaign, it is likely that this is
                            managed by one or two people within your business, which can lead to the strategy becoming
                            stale and limited. Whereas a Google Adwords has a full team dedicated to Google Adwords
                            alone, this helps to find sources for growth and keeps the PPC campaign fresh and effective.
                            Multi-disciplinary: Agencies have a multi-disciplinary team, they have experts in keyword
                            research, bids, campaigns etc. which means you have a vast array of knowledge available to
                            you. This helps to ensure that every aspect of your campaign is well thought out and is
                            running as efficiently as possible.
                            Stability: By using an agency you no longer have the worry of what will happen to your
                            Google Adwords campaign if the person managing it within your company were to leave. If this
                            happens when you are working with an agency, someone else will simply take over your account
                            for you.

                        <p class="dpm-description">
                            If you’ve already started looking for a Google Adwords company you will have noticed that
                            there are a lot of them around, which makes choosing just one even more difficult. So, how
                            do you make the decision on which to choose? Here are some things you should look for from
                            your Adwords PPC management:

                            Experience: Selecting a Google Ads Management agency that has vast experience in PPC, Google
                            Adwords and marketing strategies is incredibly important. When you research Google Adwords
                            companies be sure to look at the experience they have and read testimonials from previous or
                            current clients.
                            Certifications: All companies should be able to provide evidence of their certifications in
                            Google Adwords and PPC. Before you choose to use an Adwords management agency, take a look
                            at the certifications they have and if you cannot see evidence on their website, request
                            copies of their certifications.
                            Realistic expectations: avoid companies that promise immediate results and a drastic
                            improvement to your ranking. While companies do significantly increase your ranking, often
                            within a short period of time, they cannot make your website the most popular website that
                            ever was, overnight.

                        <p class="dpm-description">
                            A paid search agency and a Google Ads company are very similar, the services they provide
                            are both considered as PPC services. However, they differ in the sense of a paid search
                            agency will likely cover a wide range of PPC services, from Google to social media, whereas
                            a Google Ads company will focus solely on Google Adwords. Which type of company you should
                            choose very much depends on what you are hoping to achieve. If you’re solely looking for a
                            company that can manage your Google Adwords and you are not interested in any other PPC
                            service, then a Google Ads management service is perfect for you. However, do keep in mind
                            that you may want to branch out your marketing strategy to other platforms, not just Google.
                            If you use a paid search agency then it will be much easier for you to extend your marketing
                            campaign to other platforms, whereas if you use just a Google Ads company, it won’t be so
                            easy and you may have to look for another paid search agency for help.

                            This could mean you end up paying more than you should and not seeing the results promised

                            what’s more, these forms of marketing no longer serve their purpose, they don’t drive
                            traffic to a business the way that they used to. For this reason, companies are now
                            investing in digital marketing services, such as SEO content and PPC advertising. Adwords
                            PPC management companies are used in replacement of traditional marketing companies now, not
                            only are they more cost-effective, but the marketing campaign is much more effective in the
                            digital age we live in. Read more about this great advertising shift in this blog from the

                        </h3>
                        <p class="dpm-description">
                            Another advantage of using the best Google marketing company is that they can often think of
                            new and innovative ways to leverage Google Adwords for your benefit. Here are just five, of
                            the many ways, Google can be used by a Google Ads management agency to ensure your PPC
                            campaign is more effective:

                            Poaching clients from competitors: by using Google Adwords you can reach customers during
                            the final stage of them researching and making a purchase. To do this, you need to set-up
                            adverts on the brand names of your biggest competitors, instead of bidding on and placing
                            focus on keywords.
                            Targeting an audience that isn’t ready to buy yet: typically speaking this is the opposite
                            of what businesses usually do. Most businesses will target an audience that is ready to make
                            a purchase, however, this isn’t always the best option. John Leo Weber, the VP of Marketing
                            at ProjectManager.com, states “Most advertisers bid on high buyer-intent keywords because
                            they see Adwords as a conversion engine”, he goes onto say that “Instead, advertisers should
                            treat Adwords as a traffic engine. You can bid on lower buyer-intent keywords to bring
                            traffic to your site, and put people into funnels to be targeted in other ways.” Buy using
                            PPC like this, you can get potential customers and leads for a much cheaper price.
                            Decide who you don’t want to sell too: Google Adwords doesn’t just let you target your
                            audience with keywords, it also lets you avoid selling to certain audiences, through the use
                            of negative keywords. For example, if you wanted to avoid selling to schools, you can add
                            the negative words “schools”, “school”, “university” etc. This will then mean that your
                            advert is not shown to people who use those search terms. Using negative keywords like this
                            helps you to better target an audience that is more likely to convert into a paying
                            customer.
                            SEO keyword research: According to Elliot Brown, the director of marketing at OnPay, Inc.,
                            “Adwords data is invaluable for SEO keyword research. If people are willing to pay for
                            traffic from certain keywords, it’s worth making an effort to get that same traffic for
                            free.” Using Google Adwords to highlight the most effective keywords enables you to
                            implement these keywords into your marketing strategy, ultimately driving more traffic to
                            your website.
                            Gauge customer interest: If you are thinking of trying something new, for example, if you’d
                            like to change your brand message, you might be wondering how your customers will feel about
                            this and whether it is something you should do. This is where Google Adwords can help. To
                            test out new ideas, you can simply run a new campaign and see how effective it is. This is
                            much cheaper, and quicker, than paying out for research studies and it can really help you
                            to expand your business.

                            Every Google Adwords management company will charge a different price for their Google
                            Adwords packages, some might charge more than others. While the price they charge is
                            important, what’s more important is choosing a company that best suits your business needs
                            and has experience in the industry. While it might be tempting to select the cheapest PPC
                            management agency, this could end up costing you more in the long run if the company does
                            not create and integrate a strong strategy. See the range of Google Adwords packages offered

                        <p class="dpm-description">
                            It can be a massive mistake to not thoroughly research your PPC marketing company before
                            making the decision to use it. Rushing in like this can lead to you choosing a PPC marketing
                            company:

                            That is not certified.
                            That locks you into a contract.
                            Is a small company run by only one person.
                            That uses autopilot software to manage your PPC campaign.
                            Which makes small/minor changes in minimal time, which they then charge a whole month’s
                            worth of work for.
                            Has no evidence of previous success.
                            That isn’t testing their own website.
                            Who is not open about their pricing.
                            Penalise you for any late payments.
                            Before you make the decision to use an Adwords management agency ask plenty of questions
                            such as, how do you charge? Is it per campaign, per ad group, per keyword etc? Don’t be
                            afraid to ask for evidence of previous successes and certifications, an experienced PPC
                            marketing company will be happy to answer any questions you have and provide any evidence
                            you require.
